<h1>Vulnerability Scanner</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This script is written to scan the services that are running on any WordPress website and Docker networks. It will check the services for vulnerabilities and provide a report. The script is written in Kotlin.</p>
<p>The script gives user two options:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Manual:</b> Get services input file from user.</li>
    <li><b>Docker:</b> Scan Docker networks for existing services.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Caution: Do not use this script for unethical and illegal purposes.</b></p>
<p>This project leverages <a href="https://github.com/parsamlm/VulnerabilityFinder">VulnerabilityFinder</a> to retrieve potential vulnerabilities affecting the services from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API. To maximize the number of permissible requests and ensure optimal performance, it is highly recommended to <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key">request an NVD API key</a>.</p>
<p>Following the successful retrieval of your API key, proceed to copy and paste it into the designated file, 'src/main/resources/nvd_api.json'. For your reference, an illustrative example is provided below:</p>

```json
{
  "apiKey": "[ENTER YOUR API KEY]"
}
```

<h2>1. Manual</h2>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<h4>Input</h4>
<p>This option requires the creation of an input file in the <b>JSON format</b>. This file can specify various services you wish to analyze.  The input file should be placed within the project's dedicated <b>"resources"</b> directory. The JSON file structure should adhere to the following attributes:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Mandatory Attributes</b> that are needed to be declared in the file:
        <ol>
            <li><b>url:</b> the <b>WordPress</b> website domain.</li>
            <li><b>type:</b> <b>WordPress</b>, <b>Apache</b> (Web Server), or <b>MySQL</b></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
<br>
    <li><b>Optional Attributes</b> that can be declared in the file:
        <ol>
            <li>ipAddress: the IP Address of the WordPress website domain.</li>
            <li>ports: it might have several ports, so it should be declared as an array.</li>
            <li>vendor: the service vendor.</li>
            <li>version: if it is not declared by the file, the script will find the version of the service itself.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Example of required to be input file:</p>

```json
[
  {
    "ipAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "url": "http://localhost/[your_website_name]/",
    "ports": [
      "80/tcp"
    ],
    "vendor": "wordpress",
    "type": "wordpress",
    "version": "6.5.2"
  }
]
```

<h2>2. Docker</h2>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To start working with this option, you need to install <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>. After installation, run the installed application in order to Docker Daemon will be started, otherwise you cannot use the script.</li>
    <li>The script will scan different networks available on the Docker, then asks user a network name, and scan the network services. So, you need to make at least one service in a network in Docker to test the script functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>docker-compose.yml: </b>This file contains three containers' config (including WordPress, Apache web server, and MySQL, and a network that
will be created. Before doing anything, you have to start Docker Daemon.</p>
<code>docker-compose up -d</code>
<br><br>
<caption>
    <b>-d: </b>it will run the command in detached mode.
    <br>
    <b>Note: </b>Run the given command on an opened terminal in the 'wordpress-docker' directory.
    <br>
