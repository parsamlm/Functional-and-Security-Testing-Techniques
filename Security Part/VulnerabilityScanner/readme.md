<h1>Vulnerability Scanner</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This script is written to scan the services that are running on any WordPress website and Docker networks. It will check the services for vulnerabilities and provide a report. The script is written in Kotlin.</p>
<p>The script gives user two options:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Manual:</b> Get services input file from user.</li>
    <li><b>Docker:</b> Scan Docker networks for existing services.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Caution: Do not use this script for unethical and illegal purposes.</b></p>
<h2>1. Manual</h2>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>For this option, you need to create an input file (in <b>.json format</b>) which might have different services. The input file have to be placed in <b><i>'resources'</i></b> directory in the project. The .json file might have these attributes:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Mandatory Attributes</b> that are needed to be declared in the input file:
        <ol>
            <li>url: the WordPress website domain.</li>
            <li>type: WordPress, Apache Web Server, or MySQL</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>Optional Attributes</b> that are needed to be declared in the input file:
        <ol>
            <li>ipAddress: the IP Address of the WordPress website domain.</li>
            <li>ports: it might have several ports, so it should be declared as an array.</li>
            <li>vendor: the service vendor.</li>
            <li>version: if it is not declared by the file, the script will find the version of the service itself.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Example of required input file:</p>

```json
[
  {
    "ipAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "url": "http://localhost/[your_website_name]/",
    "ports": [
      "80/tcp"
    ],
    "vendor": "wordpress",
    "type": "wordpress",
    "version": "6.5.2"
  }
]
```

<h2>2. Docker</h3>
<h3>Requirements:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>To start working with this option, you need to install <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>. After installation, run the installed application in order to Docker Daemon will be started, otherwise you cannot use the script.</li>
    <li>The script will scan different networks available on the Docker, then asks user a network name, and scan the network services. So, you need to make at least one service in a network in Docker to test the script functionality.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>docker-compose.yml: </b>This file contains three containers' config (including WordPress, Apache web server, and MySQL, and a network that
will be created. Before doing anything, you have to start Docker Daemon.</p>
<code>docker-compose up -d</code>
<br><br>
<caption>
    <b>-d: </b>it will run the command in detached mode.
    <br>
    <b>Note: </b>Run the given command on an opened terminal in the 'wordpress-docker' directory.
    <br>
