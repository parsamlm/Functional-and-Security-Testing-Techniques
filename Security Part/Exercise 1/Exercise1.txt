Question:
Find examples of companies/products:
 - Which can be considered «good enough»
 - Arriving first on the market and remaining the sector leaders, even if not the
    best choice (e.g., from technical point of view)
 - Changing their business model on the run to satisfy market needs

 Answer:
 ClubHouse can be an answer for this question as it published when it was good enough to be on the market,
 but it wasn't a complete application. The application was accessible only by referral code for a long period
 of time, but after a while, they changed their business model to make it available for everyone even
 without referral code.
