<h1>Functional and Security Testing Techniques</h1>
<p><b>Functional Testing Techniques</b> aim to verify if a software application functions as intended according to the requirements and specifications.
<b>Security Testing Techniques</b> focus on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in a software application that could be exploited by attackers.</p>
<p>This course is part of Master of Computer Science (Software & Security Engineering track) programme at university of Genoa, Italy.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>In the context of this course, four web applications were subjected to testing procedures. Two of these applications were tested manually, while the remaining applications were tested using automated tools â€“ specifically, <b><i>Selenium</i></b> and <b><i>Assessor+</i></b>.</p>
<p><u>A list of the four web applications tested is provided below:</u></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bludit:</b> This web application was tested using Selenium and Assessor+.</li>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<h4>Web Service Monitoring Project</h4>
<p>This project implements a monitoring service for web service environments, it is developed in Kotlin by me.</p>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>The goal is to monitor a company's website for potential vulnerabilities. The program supports MySQL, WordPress, MongoDB, and Apache Web Server, also it will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a list of network services (IP, port, URL, service type) as input.</li>
<li>Dynamically discover the running version of each service (e.g., WordPress 6.4.3).</li>
<li>Identify potential vulnerabilities based on the service type and version using public vulnerability databases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional Features</h4>
<p>The developed program is able to run in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually Takes Input File (Json file is supported)</li>
<li>Automatically finds different networks in Docker and gets one from user selection, and look for its services and their vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>This project is done individually and the program will generate a report file (both PDF and Json) listing vulnerabilities affecting each service, if any.</p>
<p>The project is available at this <a href="https://github.com/parsamlm/Functional-and-Security-Testing-Techniques/tree/master/Security%20Part/VulnerabilityScanner"><b>link</b></a>.</p>
<h4>Additional Works</h4>
<p>In parallel with the development of this tool, I created an open-source Kotlin library named <a href="https://github.com/parsamlm/VulnerabilityFinder"><b>VulnerabilityFinder</b></a>. This library simplifies interacting with the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a> website within Kotlin applications, facilitating the retrieval of service vulnerability information.</p>
