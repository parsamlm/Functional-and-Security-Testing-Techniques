# Gherkin Test Case for the Spring PetClinic Project

<h4>Question:</h4>
I would ask you this week to download and install PetClinic on your laptop and then write the Gherkin test cases
 (using any editor) for this app. If you can try to apply the systematic approach.
Then you can test manually PetClinic using the Gherkin test cases you have produced.
 You can deliver the .txt (or .doc) file containing the Gherkin test cases.
