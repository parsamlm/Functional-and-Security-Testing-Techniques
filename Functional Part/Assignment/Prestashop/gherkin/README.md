Gherkin specifications for Prestashop
----------------------

This directory contains Gherkin speficiations and an automated installer for Prestashop.

# Deployment instructions
The Docker containers for the application under test can be created using the following commands:


```bash
#Prestashop 1.6.1.23
docker network create prestashop-net 
docker run -ti --name some-mysql --network prestashop-net -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin -p 3307:3306 -d mysql:5.7
docker run -ti --name some-prestashop --network prestashop-net -e DB_SERVER=some-mysql -p 8080:80 -d prestashop/prestashop:1.6.1.23
```


The web application will be exposed on `localhost:8080`. After the containers are deployed, an installation wizard must be followed

# Installation instructions
The installation wizard can be executed automatically by running `InstallerTest.install` (located in the Maven project `prestashop-installer-1.6.1.23`) as a JUnit test. You can run it with Maven using the command 
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=InstallerTest#install
``` 
in the directory `prestashop-installer-1.6.1.23`. If, for any reason, the automatic installation fails, these are the parameters that you should set in the installation wizard:
If, for any reason, the automatic installation fails, these are the parameters that you should set in the installation wizard:

* Language: English (English)
* Shop name: E2E Web Testing store
* Main activity: Computer Hardware and Software
* First name: Dario
* Second name: Olianas
* E-mail address: admin@prestashop.com
* Password: password
* Database server address: some-mysql
* Database password: admin
* Click "Test your database connection now!", then "Attempt to create the database automatically"

After the installation is complete, you need to perform some manual post-installation steps from the command line. 
Open a shell to the container with the command

```bash
docker exec -it some-prestashop bash
```

then remove the `install` directory and rename the `admin` directory to `administrator`

```bash
rm -rf install
mv admin administrator
```
